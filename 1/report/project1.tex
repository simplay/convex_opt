\section{Demosaicing}

\subsection{Motivation}
Most digital cameras acquire images from an image sensor overlaid with a color filter array (CFA). A color filter array depicts a mosaic of RGB color filters applied in front of the image sensor. An example is illustrated in figure $FIGURE$. This implies that each pixel in a raw camera image stores only the measured color channel value that corresponds to its pixel-position in the CFA. In other words, each pixel in a raw camera image represents one RGB color. Its color value depends on the color filter that is applied to that pixel. 

Such a raw filter image does no look like we humans are used to see images. Therefore goal is to reconstruct the missing color channel information from the pixel's neighborhood. The described problem is also known as \emph{demosaicing}. One particular way how to address this problem is by is by billinearly interpolating the missing color information from a pixel's neighborhood. This is straight forward approach and can be implemented by solving a huge sparse linear system of equations. However, the resulting image may exhibits notable artifacts - colorfull fringes along texture-boundaries. Usually, this can be fixed by applying a non-linear filtering approach, such as a median filter. Such a filtering approach, however, assumes spatial coherence of the raw image's pixel.

Since this approach is less mathematical sound we focus on another approach in this project. We try to formulate the the demosaicing task as a convex minimization problem.     

\subsection{Problem Statement}
In this work we address the problem of demosaicing by formulating it as a convex optimization problem. Given a mosaiced image $g$ depicting a raw camera production, we want to find an optimal demosaiced image $u$. For describing the optimality property we take into account a cost function that describes the color smoothness and also that the resulting image $u$ should be close to the given raw input image $g$. 

More precisely, let $g$ denote the bayer filter camera raw input image. Then we want to solve for $u=(u_r, u_g, u_g)$ (RGB image) minimzating the following energy term (cost function):

\begin{align}
	E(u_c) = \norm{\nabla u_c}_2 + \frac{\lambda}{2} \norm{u_c - g}^2_{\Omega_{c}}
\label{eq:basis_cost_demosaicing}	
\end{align}

with the measure

\begin{equation}
	\norm{u_C - g}^2_{\Omega_{C}} = \sum_x \sum_y \Omega_{C}(x,y)\norm{u_{c}(x,y) - g(x,y)}^2
\label{eq:measure}
\end{equation}

where C denotes the three different color channels. $\Omega_{C}$ is defined such that $\Omega_{C}(x,y) = 1$ if the pixel value at $(x,y)$ is \emph{valid}$\footnote{this means that the pixel at location (x,y) is valid for the bayer color mask C}$ and $\Omega_{C}(x,y) = 0$ when the data is missing.

The cost function from equation $\ref{eq:basis_cost_demosaicing}$ consists of a smoothness term, $\norm{\nabla u_c}_2$ and $\norm{u_c - g}^{2}_{\Omega_{c}}$. The first term ensures a smooth color transition between colors in a l2 norm sense. The second term ensures that the reconstructed images does not deviate too much from the given input, i.e. de demosaiced image should resemble to the provided mosaiced raw camera image. This similarity term is further parameterized by a regularization term $\lambda$, indicating how strong the output should match the given input according to the formulated measure in equation $\ref{eq:measure}$. In summary, larger values for $\lambda$ weight the similarity of the input and output image more, and contrarely, lower values weight the color smoothness term more.

Hereby, minimizating the cost function from equation $\ref{eq:basis_cost_demosaicing}$ leads to an optimal demosaiced image $u$.
Mathematically we want to solve for 

\begin{equation}
	\widetilde{u} = \argmin_{u_c} E(u_c)
\end{equation}

We can further simplify the cost function stated in equation $\ref{eq:basis_cost_demosaicing}$ relying on the following observation: Since the function $\Omega_{C}$ is only true for pixels that correspond to the color channel C in the bayer mask, we see that $\Omega_{C}(x,y)\norm{u_{c}(x,y) - g(x,y)}$ is only not equal zero if the pixel at location $(x,y)$ belongs to the color channel $C$. Therefore we are allowed to solve the stated optimization problem from equation $\ref{eq:basis_cost_demosaicing}$ for each color channel separately. 


According to this insight we are supposed to minimize the following three independent$\footnote{Independent in the sense that we are allowed to solve for each color channel separately}$ convex problems:

\begin{align}
	\widetilde{u_R} = \argmin_{u_R} \norm{\nabla u_R}_2 + \frac{\lambda}{2} \norm{u_R - g}^2_{\Omega_{R}} \\
	\widetilde{u_G} = \argmin_{u_G} \norm{\nabla u_G}_2 + \frac{\lambda}{2} \norm{u_G - g}^2_{\Omega_{G}}\\
	\widetilde{u_B} = \argmin_{u_B} \norm{\nabla u_R}_2 + \frac{\lambda}{2} \norm{u_B - g}^2_{\Omega_{B}}		
\end{align}

Where we still rely on the measure defined in equation $\ref{eq:measure}$ but C was replayed by the appropriate color channel$\footnote{C stands for either the color channel R, G or B.}$.

\subsection{Gradient Descend}

\begin{align}
	u_{c}(i,j) = u_{c}(i,j) - \alpha \frac{\partial{E}}{\partial{u_{c} (i,j)}}(i,j)
\end{align}

where $c$ denotes the substitute for either one of the following r,g,b color channels. $\Omega$

\subsection{Derivations}

In this subsection we derive an explicit approximation for the the partial derivative of our energy term $E$ that can be numerically computed. Such an approximation is useful since we will need its expression later for our update rule to solve our demosaicing optimization problem. For the discretization we will relying on a forward difference scheme. In other by the end of this section we will have derived an discretization of the following expression $\frac{\partial{E}}{\partial{u_{c} (i,j)}}(i,j)$. \\

% TODO: glue those two paragraphs somehow

using a forward difference approximation scheme for the derivatives $\partial_{i} u_c$ and $\partial_{j} u_c$ respectively, we can derive the following expression for the regularization term:

\begin{align}
	 \norm{\nabla{u_{c}}}_2 
	&= \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=1}^M \sqrt{[\partial_{i} u_c(i,j)]^2 + [\partial_{j} u_c(i,j)]^2} \nonumber \\ 
	&= \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=1}^M \sqrt{\left[ u_{c}\left(i+1, j\right) - u_{c}\left(i,j\right) \right]^2 + \left[ u_{c}\left(i, j+1 \right) - u_{c}\left(i,j\right) \right]^2}
\label{eq:regularization_expr}
\end{align}

In oder to simplify later derivation steps, let us introduce the helper function $\tau$ defined as the following 

\begin{equation}
	 \tau_{c}\left(i,j\right)
	= \sqrt{\left[ u_{c}\left(i+1, j\right) - u_{c}\left(i,j\right) \right]^2 + \left[ u_{c}\left(i, j+1 \right) - u_{c}\left(i,j\right) \right]^2}
\end{equation}

We notice that $\tau$ is only the expression under the summation in the right hand side in equation $\ref{eq:regularization_expr}$. Next, let us take the partial derivative along $u_{c}(i,j)$ of $\norm{\nabla{u_{c}}}_2$. By fixing a index pair ($i$ $j$) and reordering the terms under the summation, we see that 

\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial}{\partial u_{c}\left(i,j\right)} \norm{\nabla{u_c}}_2 = \underbrace{\frac{\partial{\tau_{c}\left(i,j\right)}}{\partial u_{c}\left(i,j\right)}}_{\bf{(a)}} + \underbrace{\frac{\partial{\tau_{c}\left(i-1,j\right)}}{\partial u_{c}\left(i,j\right)}}_{\bf{(b)}} + \underbrace{\frac{\partial{\tau_{c}\left(i,j-1\right)}}{\partial u_{c}\left(i,j\right)}}_{\bf{(c)}}
\end{equation}

Next I will derive explicit expressions for the terms $\bf{(a)}$, $\bf{(b)}$ and $\bf{(c)}$. Loosely speaking our goal is to get rid of the partial derivative operator. The mathematical key concept I will rely on is the chain rule for partial derivatives. More precisely we will make use of the fact that $\partial_{x}\sqrt{f(x)}$ is $\frac{\partial_{x} f(x)}{2 \sqrt{f(x)}}$.

\begin{align}
	(a) \Longrightarrow
	& \frac{\partial{\tau_{c}\left(i,j\right)}}{\partial u_{c}\left(i,j\right)} \nonumber \\
	&= \frac{\partial}{\partial{u_{c}\left(i,j\right)}} \sqrt{ \left[u_{c}(i+1,j) - u_{c}(i,j)\right]^2 + \left[u_{c}(i,j+1) - u_{c}(i,j)\right]^2} \nonumber \\
	&= \frac{1}{2} \frac{2 (u_{c}(i+1,j)-u_{c}(i,j))(0-1) + 2 (u_{c}(i,j+1)-u_{c}(i,j))(0-1)}{\sqrt{ \left[u_{c}(i+1,j) - u_{c}(i,j)\right]^2 + \left[u_{c}(i,j+1) - u_{c}(i,j)\right]^2}} \nonumber \\
	&= \frac{1}{2} \frac{2 [-(u_{c}(i+1,j)-u_{c}(i,j)) - (u_{c}(i,j+1)-u_{c}(i,j)]}{\tau_{c}\left(i,j\right)} \nonumber \\
	&= \frac{2 u_{c} \left(i,j\right) - u_{c} \left(i+1,j\right)-u_{c} \left(i,j+1\right)}{\tau_{c}\left(i,j\right)}
\end{align}

\begin{align}
(b) \Longrightarrow
	& \frac{\partial{\tau_{c}\left(i-1,j\right)}}{\partial u_{c}\left(i,j\right)} \nonumber \\
	&= \frac{\partial}{\partial{u_{c}\left(i,j\right)}} \sqrt{ \left[u_{c}(i,j) - u_{c}(i-1,j)\right]^2 + \left[u_{c}(i-1,j+1) - u_{c}(i-1,j)\right]^2} \nonumber \\
	&= \frac{1}{2} \frac{2[\left(u_{c}(i,j) - u_{c}(i-1,j)\right)(1-0) + \left(u_{c}(i-1,j+1) - u_{c}(i-1,j)\right)(0-0)]}{\sqrt{ \left[u_{c}(i,j) - u_{c}(i-1,j)\right]^2 + \left[u_{c}(i-1,j+1) - u_{c}(i-1,j)\right]^2}} \nonumber \\
	&= \frac{1}{2} \frac{2\left[(u_{c}(i,j) - u_{c}(i-1,j)\right]}{\tau_{c}\left(i-1,j\right)} \nonumber \\
	&= \frac{u_{c}\left(i,j\right) - u_{c}\left(i-1,j\right)}{\tau_{c}\left(i-1,j\right)}
\end{align}

\begin{align}
(c) \Longrightarrow
	& \frac{\partial{\tau_{c}\left(i,j-1\right)}}{\partial u_{c}\left(i,j\right)} \nonumber \\
	&= \frac{\partial}{\partial{u_{c}\left(i,j\right)}} \sqrt{ \left[u_{c}(i+1,j-1)-u_{c}(i,j-1)\right]^2 + \left[u_{c}(i,j) - u_{c}(i,j-1)\right]^2} \nonumber \\
	&=  \frac{1}{2} \frac{2 [\left(u_{c}(i+1,j-1)-u_{c}(i,j-1)\right)(0 - 0) + \left(u_{c}(i,j) - u_{c}(i,j-1)\right)(1-0)]}{\sqrt{ \left[u_{c}(i+1,j-1)-u_{c}(i,j-1)\right]^2 + \left[u_{c}(i,j) - u_{c}(i,j-1)\right]^2}} \nonumber \\
	&= \frac{1}{2} \frac{2 \left[u_{c}(i,j)- u_{c} (i,j-1)\right] }{\tau_{c}\left(i,j-1\right)} \nonumber \\			
	&= \frac{u_{c}(i,j)-u_{c} \left(i,j-1\right)}{\tau_{c}\left(i,j-1\right)}
\end{align}
